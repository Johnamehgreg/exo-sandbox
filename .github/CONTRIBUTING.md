   - Before starting any task, create a GitHub issue and describe what your task is about.

1. **Descriptive Titles and Descriptions**:
   - Use a clear and descriptive title for your PR.
   - Provide a detailed description of the changes made in the PR.
   - Include screenshots (if applicable) to illustrate changes:
     - **Before** (optional) and **After** screenshots are highly encouraged to help reviewers understand the impact of your changes.

2. **Atomic Changes**:
   - Keep PRs atomic, meaning each PR should represent a **single unit of change**.
   - This approach ensures that changes are easier to review and, if needed, revert.

3. **Commit Structure**:
   - Aim to have one meaningful commit per PR.
   - Squash commits if necessary to ensure a clean and concise commit history.
